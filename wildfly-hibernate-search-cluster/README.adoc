Wildfly Hibernate Search With Clustering
======================

The point of this experiment is to:

* have hibernate search indexing model objects
* have hibernate search events going to a JMS Queue
* have an indexer application writing the lucene index to Infinispan

To run the servers
------------------
server 1: +
 ./standalone.sh -server-config server_01.xml -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=0 -Dnodename=node1

server 2: +
 ./standalone.sh -server-config server_02.xml -Djboss.socket.binding.port-offset=1 -Dnodename=node2

You can run both servers with the same installation of Wildfly but you must have a unique basedir.
The easiest way to do this is copy the standalone directory and then add the following to startup: +
 -Djboss.server.base.dir=/path/to/standalone

On OSX (and maybe linux), if you are running both servers on one machine
you have to run the following command to set up a loopback route: +
sudo route add 224.0.0.0 127.0.0.1 -netmask 240.0.0.0
